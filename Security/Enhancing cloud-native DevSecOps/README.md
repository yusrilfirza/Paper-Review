## Paper summary (What)
The paper addresses the challenges financial institutions face when adopting cloud-native and microservices-based DevSecOps environments, specifically the increased complexity and security risks. It focuses on implementing the Zero Trust security model to address these issues.

## Issues addressed by the paper (Why)
As financial institutions modernize their infrastructure, traditional perimeter-based security becomes insufficient. The growing complexity and attack surface demand a more advanced, automated, and granular security approach like Zero Trust. However, thereâ€™s a lack of practical guidance and foundational material for adoption.

## Detailed Information (How)
The study analyzes the relationship between cloud-native practices, DevSecOps, and Zero Trust. It introduces a stage-by-stage framework for implementing Zero Trust throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and evaluates its effectiveness using nine assessment criteria.
